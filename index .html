        <p>Plants are one of six big groups (kingdoms) of living things. They are autotrophic eukaryotes, which means
            they have complex cells, and make their own food. Usually they cannot move (not counting growth). Plants
            include familiar types such as trees, herbs, bushes, grasses, vines, ferns, mosses, and green algae.</p>

                The roots of plants perform two main functions. First, they anchor the plant to the ground. Second, they absorb water and various nutrients dissolved in water from the soil. Plants use the water to make food. The water also provides the plant with support. Plants that lack water become very limp and their stems cannot support their leaves. Plants which specialise in desert areas are called xerophytes or phreatophytes, depending on the type of root growth.

Water is transported from the roots to the rest of the plant through special vessels in the plant. When the water reaches the leaves, some of it evaporates into the air. Many plants need the help of fungi to make their roots work properly. This plant/fungi symbiosis is called mycorrhiza. Rhizobia bacteria in root nodules help some plants get nitrogen
